>#+title: Minimalist way to run the computer with Linux

Well, my requirement to do with computer was/is always minimal. As, I have said
it on other places, that I am NOT doing any rocket science or overly complicated
stuff to use plethora of technologies together to achieve something rudimentary.

So, I do mostly very predictive and deterministic work,as a result I can almost
pinpoint what I need to accomplish my work, in other term "workflow".

I do exclusively run GNU/Linux on my machines(Desktop/Laptop) for ages. No,
second kind of OS reside in the machine from the day I have purchased my first
machine.Of late, although I have been dabbling a bit with FreeBSD too and that's
for different reason. At this moment , I do have five specific GNU/Linux distros
in my machine , all in their respective physical partitions, namely,
[[https://www.gentoo.org/][Gentoo]],[[http://www.slackware.com/][Slackware]],[[https://www.debian.org/][Debian]],[[https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/][Opensuse-Tumbleweed]] and [[https://archlinux.org/][Arch]] . The only OTHER OS present
is [[https://www.freebsd.org/][FreeBSD]] .

I do not use any desktop environment but use one specific tiling window manager
, i.e [[https://i3wm.org/][I3WM]] and I am sticking with it for past 6 years . There was/is temptation
to use other "well circulated" tiling window manager , but I refused to port on
and using what I have been using for sometimes. It saves time and energy.

And,to do some real work I needed some tool to be installed in my system . To
some extents below list of packages I have pulled in:

vim
vifm
vimb
git
surf
mpv
cmus
zathura
i3
i3blocks
i3lock
dmenu
neofetch
etckeeper
lsof
htop
mutt
postfix
newsboat
screen
lynx
w3m
gpg2
lvm2
cronie
isync
calcurse
kmon
pass
curl
scrot
wget
rsync
imgmagick
psutils
moreutils
findutils
compilers(gcc collections and llvm collections)
emacs
taskwarrior

That's pretty much it! One or two interesting here and there but nothing
permanent in system. Once I end dabble with the newly bring in stuff , then
throw away those.But ,above packages are pretty much stagnated in my machine.

I wanted my system to be lean but powerful and these packages helps me to
achieve that almost 90 percent.

But, having those packages not only one, it brings down some other packages as
dependency. Fortunately except webkit2gtk every thing else are pretty small and
negligible.This big packages has webkit2gtk is required by [[https://fanglingsu.github.io/vimb/][Vimb]] .

I do not run and like virtual machines. But I do sometimes run [[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]] to test some
kernel related stuff. Bare metal is fine and the best. I have tried and tested
virtual machines and come to a conclusion that if the underlying machine is not
fatty enough , then the performance of virtual machine will be horrific.

The most stressful work I do is build the kernel with several config options and
run some test with it on qemu. Every thing else very lightweight.

Now, you can argue , that browsing or net surfing itself a heavy duty work and I
would completely agree with you.But having said that, most of the places I visit
have more text than visual in any other form. And those stuff will breeze through
because lack of graphics component processing on the fly.

Dealing with more text than other form of information gives me more joy and the
fast processing of stuff elated me.Emacs probably only big GUI app on my system
, otherwise most of the things are text base and few of them have TUI interface.

Open source provide you the choice to live with the things you like and I grabbed
it on both hands.Vendor lock in doesn't go well with me. But , wait , open
source software too insists you to stick around with it , that means the
"camping" or "lock in" too.So, you need to use your conscience to decide , which
or what you want to live with , I do.

On the other hand,I do love "bleeding edge" stuff only related to my liking ,
for instance the Linux kernel. But, I have always keep myself distanced from the
"trendy" and "hot" technology trend ,even it is promoted by the renowned and
liked people. I have seen those hypes are very short-lived and had had bad
consequences. Also, I have the lacuna to not run behind something where ten other
people are mindlessly running to hog the limelight.

Living with my choice of software and the blessings of open source software
taught me that sticking with something for long time allows you to get more insight
about the project and importantly to understand it. Expertise comes from doing the
thing you like over and over again in various way to see and compare the result
of it.Moreover, I don't have the bent of mind to grasp so many things at once.

I do love minimalist system , which allow power and flexibility to adopt and do
some heavy duty work under the hood without much ado.

In other words,my life with computer is pretty boring. Why? Because, I am stuck
with an OS for over 20 year (read GNU/Linux) and with one window manager for
past 6 years (read i3 window manger) and the mentioned packages above. Machine
changed, time changed but the crux remains the same.Few of the packages are
comparatively recent addition but most stays long time.

Muttering out my love! :)
