One of the a few rare moments is when I hop into a specific Linux distribution,
namely /Arch Linux,/ and start one of my editor and surprise(read annoyed) by
encountering a stupid error.

Here is what I got while trying to compose a blog post in customary style like
every other time :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2024-01-02-063454_1920x1200_scrot.png]]

Clearly, it is an *ispell* error.

In spite of having /ispell/ installed and it still spits out an error like this :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2024-01-02-063502_1920x1200_scrot.png]]

So, it is missing the /words/ file. I had to get it .

And the problem vanishes once restart the Emacs daemon and client.
