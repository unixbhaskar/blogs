#+title: WTF How To Solve Webkit-gtk Compile Error Problem In Gentoo

#+tags: Technical Gentoo Linux Compiler Memory Shell Package Opensource


Bloody hell !! This damn thing bugs me a couple of times and I thought it might
bother other people too. And importantly knowing the reason eluded most people
like me, who failed to give attention to the failure log properly.

It all started when /Gentoo/ has update for *webkit-gtk* package and having set the
*MAKEOPTS and MAKEJOBS set as per the cpu and memory available in the system
will certainly backfire and it did to me.

How it looked like when it failed:

Now,BAM! What does that even mean?? Not so withstanding. So,like an intuition, I
scrolled up and saw the log said this :

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
internal compiler error: Illegal instruction
#+END_SRC

Hmmm, so clue, but what about it explicitly? After spending some hours(resisting
the temptation to go to the internet and search), I have surrendered and found
this :

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus
#+END_SRC

So, it is *running out of memory* ....irks...the machine has 16 gigs of RAM and
still it is failing and it is not involved in any other memory consuming
activity.

Puzzling! Right?

My *make.conf* file having a /-j10 -l10/ setting to speed things up, although it
could go up and I haven't put the fullest thing in place not to allow the
machine to freeze in some compile time.So, the setting was lowered and despite
this obstruction.

Compiling big package like this is time consuming, as you can see from the
history of many other packages. I have been sitting on fairly bumped hardware
and it should not take that long

Alas!

Now, I have lowered the values of compilation and while it going behind the
scenes and I am writing this piece, the entire system is very sluggish ...meh

It would certainly take more time for sure. I don't mind letting the machine do
this kind stuff once in a while and thankfully it is like so.
