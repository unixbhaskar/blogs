Alright, I am not sure about others who use this particular Linux distribution
called /Gentoo[fn:1]/. I do and it is been ages since that it has been the primary
choice of Linux distribution in my machines. Others are, namely, Debian and
Slackware.

This is a very distribution specific post,where I am going to show you the
specific stuff I do to get with the system once freshly installed on a
machine. The trick is to get a certain set of packages which helps me get along
with my day to day work on it.

Gentoo provides a facility called *package sets[fn:2]*, where you can enlist your
/required/ packages, and you can get them at once invoking a single command.

For this to work, you *have to have a directory name /sets*/ under ~/etc/portage/~
and should contain a file having all the packages needed. So, you can call up
that file like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
emerge -av @must_have_packages
#+END_SRC

It will enlist the packages you mentioned in the file and ask for your consent
to install them. My own /custom-set-packages/ file looks like this :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2024-05-30-062813_1920x1200_scrot.png]]

And when I invoke to install all those after a fresh install or some other
circumstances,then I do :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2024-05-30-063132_786x163_scrot.png]]

..and the output would look like this :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2024-05-30-063142_1920x1200_scrot.png]]

Cool! Right?

Now, you can see what are the package sets provided by simply invoking this
command on the shell :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2024-05-30-063807_1920x503_scrot.png]]

You can query the set's content like this, for instance to find out what is in
the set */system/* :

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo emerge -av @system
#+END_SRC

You can individually query all the sets enlisted. You might be interested in
what the */world/* set contains, as it is frequently use:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo emerge -av @world
#+END_SRC

You might create other package sets as per your requirement,so,it lessens roaming
to find stuff.
