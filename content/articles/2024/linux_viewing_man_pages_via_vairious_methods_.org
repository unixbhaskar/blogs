So, viewing /Linux Manual Pages/ is an integral activity that we often perform.But
the important part is, we want it to get access from anywhere in the
system. Simply, because of convenience to find out the exact details we are
sought after.

In this post, I am going to show you various ways I personally access those /man/
pages in my system. You might like it and if those any of them suits your
workflow might adapt it.

* Accessing Linux Manual Pages Via Window Manager And Associated Tools

This is a biggie, and it needs more than one tool to accomplish the job. In
crux, the integration helps to see manual pages via /dmenu/ and shows up with a
/pdf viewer/.

First I needed to curate a little script and I wrote it in bash[fn:1] (you can
use whatever language you are comfortable with) and it is essentially a borrowed
idea, so I adopted it.

Here is the little script :

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

man -k .  | dmenu -l 30 | gawk '{print $1}' | xargs -r man -Tpdf | zathura - &
#+END_SRC

You see, I am sitting on I3 Window Manager[fn:2] and using /dmenu[fn:3]/ as a
command launcher, and then using all the basic UNIX commands, and finally using
/zathura[fn:4]/ as pdf viewer.

I have a bind in the window Maker configuration file(i.e. i3 config file) like
this :

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bhaskar_13:13:50_Fri Apr 12: :~>grep manual .ithreeconfig | head -2
# Open manual page as pdf
bindsym $mod+grave exec manual_view_in_pdf
#+END_SRC

The /grave/ sign is on the same key where the /tilde/ sign is i.e. from the top
second row leftmost key on the QWERTY keyboard.

And I don't have to stretch much of my finger to use this key bind. YMMV.

* From The Terminal aka Command Line And With The Help Of FZF[fn:5]

I have a small snippet in my /.bashrc/ file which allows me to search and see the
Linux Manual page on the terminal itself.

Here is the code :

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bhaskar_13:19:36_Fri Apr 12: :~>declare -f tm
tm ()
{
    local man_page;
    man_page=$(man -k . | sort | fzf --prompt='Man Pages> ' --preview='echo {} | awk "{print \$1}" | xargs man' --preview-window=right:60%:wrap);
    man "$(echo "$man_page" | awk '{print $1}')"
}

#+END_SRC

See! Nothing much. When I invoke *tm* on command line, it shows like this :

* Accessing Linux Manual Pages Via Vim[fn:6]

This is again a borrowed idea and because I use /Vim/ extensively, so thought to
integrate with it for benefit.

Here is what I have in my /.vimrc/

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bhaskar_13:23:26_Fri Apr 12: :~>grep Man .vimrc
" Man pages with fzf
command! -nargs=? Man call fzf#run(fzf#wrap({'source': 'man -k -s 1 '.shellescape(<q-args>).' | cut -d " " -f 1', 'sink': 'tab Man', 'options': ['--preview', 'MANPAGER=bat MANWIDTH='.(&columns/2-4).' man {}']}))
nnoremap <Leader>m :Man<CR>
#+END_SRC

As you can see, I have a key bind *;a* and if I invoke that *inside Vim*, then it
will show like this:

* Accessing Linux Manual Pages Via Emacs[fn:7]

When I am inside the Emacs environment, then I try to use the wonderful
facilities provided by that environment to enhance productivity. Emacs has a way
of showing Linux manual pages,and once invoked via key cord or /M-x prompt/,it
shows like this :
