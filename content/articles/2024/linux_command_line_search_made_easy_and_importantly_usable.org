Well, like everyone else in the wild, I do spend most of my time on the /command
line/. Now one of the *common* activities sitting in that mode is finding something
often and easy way.Yes, there are tools that make things darn simple and easy at
times but most people sometimes find it daunting to get along with them.

So, as a result, I drew up something for my convenience and it is a few lines
shell script, that takes an argument and searches the file system. The plus
point is that, if the damn thing sense, it is inside a git repository then it is
use git's native grep to search through that repository, otherwise it is uses
simply find command.

Here is the script,entirety for your perusal.

Oh, it is integrated with the shell initialization file and I use /bash/ so this
function is inside the /.bashrc/ of, you might take a look on my github
repository.

Here are some interactions with the tool :

* When it is used to search normally in the filesystem!

* When it is used to search inside the git repository!

and this :

It might look trivial to you, but it is what I needed. Oh, it could have been
improved left and right, and I haven't bothered to. :)
