Alright! This is a tiny post about specifically two functions. You can
either use it directly from the command line or embed those pieces into another
script to do the job it made for. I have used them in both forms. So, thought to
share with you people. :)

The file I am using to get the stuff from is quite big and filled with so much
text. Refer to as a /README.md/ file in the screenshots.I believe the similar file
I have used in the video too.

* Extracting Email Addresses From The Document

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

filename=$1

egrep -o  "\b[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\b+" $filename
#+END_SRC

Hey,it is darn simple.In crux, it happens between the /word boundary/ and use
specific characters and symbols.

Example:

* Extracting The Web URLs From The Document

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

filename=$1

if [[ $1 == "" ]];then
	echo you need to provide the filename.
	exit 1
	fi


sed -ne 's/.*\(http[^"]*\).*/\1/p'  < $filename
#+END_SRC

Ah, it is even easier, simple capture with some regex and replay it to print.

Example:

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2024-03-30-172159_1906x222_scrot.png]]

Alternatively, You can take a peek at my [[https://youtu.be/ySOUeyA8ayU][YouTube Video]] regarding that.
