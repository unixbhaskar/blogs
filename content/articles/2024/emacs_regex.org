Well, let's start with an oddity it imposes on its users. Nonetheless, you will get
accustomed to its follies, once you fall in love with it.(It applies to every
other context too).

The first thing you noticed is that the damn /regex/ in Emacs doesn't allow */d*
notation of regular expression. But, that is quite a standard way of
representing a numeric in every other regexes. Well, you have to mention the
numeric in normal syntax[fn:1] classes.

Second, use the regex in Emacs way of invoking stuff. There are a handful of them:

And this thing is extracted out of much recommended Emacs Wiki[fn:2].

Third,some of the *very common* syntactical notation you must/should learn at the
very beginning, that you find the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Regexps.html][Syntax Of Regular Expressions]].

Fourth,Emacs has the package name *rx*[fn:3], which converts human readable syntax
to regular expressions,a very handy tool to make things easy.

Fifth, you might give a shot at *regex builder[fn:4]*, This little window allows
you to build the damn regex inside Emacs.

Sixth, You can always look at the Emacs Syntax Table[fn:5], this is for /meta
information/.

Seventh,you can always bring up regular expression syntax by invoking =C-h s= and
it will show the regex related to that specific mode you are in.

Eighth, this is a good place to find some Emacs Regex Examples[fn:6].
