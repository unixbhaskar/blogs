#+title: Gentoo Wireless Deauthentication Problem Shoot And Bring Back The Damn Network

#+tags: Technical Gentoo Opensource Wireless Linux


Damn! I have been bugged for quite some time with it and finally decided to take
a call on it.

Gentoo *deauthentication from wireless by choice(reason=3)* is/was a real
problem. Oh, haven't you started googling fanatically the moment you saw the
title?? :)

Anyway, it has been discussed in an ancient thread in [[https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-974414-start-0.html][gentoo forum]]. And I have
curated a mundane script to deal with, every time it occurs. Here is the ugly
script at your disposal:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

vpnid=$(pidof pia-daemon)

echo Checking the common cause....
echo
grep  "Gentoo kernel: wlo1: deauthenticating from" /var/log/messages | tail -n 2

echo
echo If anything blocking the connection devices....
echo

sh -c "rfkill list"

print "Is it blocking anything??[Y/N]: %s"
read -r provide

if test $provide == "Y";then
       sh -c "rfkill unblock all"

print "Is it get back the network?[Y/N]: %s"
read -r response

elif test $response == "Y";then
	echo Alright...
	sh -c "ping -c 1 10 -i.2 google.com"
	exit 1
else

echo Bouncing all network.....
echo

kill -9 $vpnid

sudo /etc/init.d/net.lo restart

sudo /etc/init.d/dhcpcd restart

sudo /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant restart

printf "\n Bounced the entire network stack.... Done\n"

sh -c "ping -c 1 10 -i.2 google.com"

fi


#+END_SRC

Pretty ordinary. Basically to bounce the damn network after checking for
blockage of any particular physical device, if so, then unblock it. And if it
fails still to get back the network, go to the conventional way of bouncing the
entire network stack.

Now, when the /deauthentication/ happens, then in the log it shows like this :

So, I have checked that pattern very first thing in the above script. But wait,
that could be happen for several other reasons too. One of them could be, when
we close the lid of a laptop, it simply disassociates from the wireless to *save
power* and that nice of it.

But, it happened while in a working state and middle of something, so I was
pissed. Most cases first part of the /if statement/ bring back the damn network on
its feet,and very seldom the last part of the /if else/ part needs to get
executed.

I have also inducted the *bssid* value i.e. the *mac address* of access point wpa
supplicant configuration for extra sure that it should not miss it by any means.

Oh, I have *ignored* a large part of /internet search results/, because most of them
were bogus and delved into something else.
