#+title: Vim Generate PDF and HTML Notes Automatically With The Help Of Pandoc

Alright, this post is all about showing you the trivialities with one of my
editors i.e. *Vim*. Basically, to automate the entire process of building /PDF/ and
/HTML/ notes via some rudimentary keystrokes.

[[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] is a damn good software for the heavy lifting behind the scene.

Let me show little by little the process involved and of course, the code that
generates those things.

See! I have designated key binds to call up for generating specific things and that
essentially call up the required script.

Bang! No fuss a simple /Pandoc/ call does the trick here.


* Generate HTML Notes

Phew! No surprise here too..abject ordinary stuff to get the job done.

I have stuck to the minimal tool to be used for this and it does the
damn job.

Okay, I have called a /*predefined template*/ file to insert specific values to
the note taking file and a few /*predefined macros*/ to fill those fields.Here is
the template file look:

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2024-05-15-130422_1920x298_scrot.png]]

Okay, if I put the cursor right next to the colon and press some keys(invoke
macros) to fill in that field. For instance, if the cursor is on the /Author/
filed and I press /au/ that fills the name of me.Likewise,on the /date/ field if I
press *dst* it pastes the current date to that field.So, I don't have to manually
fill in those fields,but rather press the keystrokes to do the job.

Pretty ordinary, right? My requirements are minimal.However, you can extend the
template file at any time wish to add more metadata to it.

Finally, if you are inclined to see how things panned out visually with live
action, then you might take a peek at my [[https://youtu.be/f2ii2twaQeE][YouTube]] video.
