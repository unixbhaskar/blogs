#+title: Opensource Tools Emacs And Vim Helps To Organize

Well, the tools mentioned in the title are *cross platform tools[fn:1]*,which
means,they can be used on various other platforms than on /Linux/. But I have been
exclusively running /Linux/ on my machines for ages(what's the big deal??), so I
better stick with that platform.

HEADS UP! None of the tools are self-fulfilling, so these have dependencies on
other tools too.

Now,these editors have the capability beyond trivialities like organizing and
reminding(which I have written about in other posts),but this feature is
certainly highlighted for the NON-tech people as well as tech people.

Let me show you the way I keep /reminding/ myself from time to time(and hopefully
you have already seen this picture before somewhere else I might have shared,
but for the sake of this post, one more time :) )

While I am sitting on /Emacs/,I have an org file that keeps track of what I am up
to and has /capture templates/ designed to capture with some keystrokes(again some
other posts I have written have more details about that mechanism) to induct
into the file and while looking at it,almost a ritual to do so, give me a sense
to what to follow up.

Here is what it looks like :

See! Not many items bother me too much. That is because I have only inducted
things that I can attend probably.Period.

Likewise,while I am inside /Vim/, I keep my /knowledge base/ within it and keep
induction if I find something interesting(the same mechanism applied in Emacs
too, so it is redundant). I might look into these /offline/ and spend prolonged
time on them to gain more insight into the topic.

Here is what the KB looks like :

That's a section shown in the above screenshots, there are more in that space,
which is not showing. :)

Again, there is an /easy method/ to induct in it and it should be, otherwise the
purpose of having them will defeat the purpose. Essentially, I took advantage of
the software package specifically made for those editors and used them as
needfully as possible.

But why do you need to be organized? (Please,don't overdo it.)

To make sure the gray cells between the ears are aligned with the steps we have
decided to follow. IOW, keep refraining from /distraction/ and noise.The more
involved in the process of the unknown the more confusion arises. Mitigating
that space is very essential to move forward in a journey. Importantly, it should
solidify your understanding of the specifics, which interest you the most.

Inside /Emacs/ I take advantage of /org mode/ to the fullest extent, this is such a
beast to know and enhances productivity to some degree as well, while in /Vim/ I
take advantage of /Vimwiki/ to lay the base for the note taking and knowledge base
build.

The invocation of the specific spice(the underlying software)
customized[fn:2](out of need) to make these tools available with minimal
effort. And I have a sincere allergy to make something more complicated than it
requires. It also means, it is after all a piece of software and it is bound to
misbehave sometime, so to /debug/ the damn thing, the implementations have to have
some sort of easy interface to get on.

Convenience doesn't mean one has to go overboard and make things happen for
them. But it surely means, before stabbing at the things make sure what you
expect out of it. This leads to a basic understanding of inspect what it can
offer in general. *Knowing your requirements is a must*. Period.

People generally tend to mold their favorite things to their liking and I am no
exception to that rule.I do what I lean on every single day for
productivity.Writing for the sake of writing and not following up stringently
makes no sense. So, knowing the tool and not taking advantage of its offering is
not so useful.

There is an adage,"A fool with a tool is nothing but a fool, If he
fails to tap the potential of it". Importantly, for your betterment.

Oh, before I let you go, my /Vim/ and /Emacs/ dot files,are having a lot to do with
this space. You might take a look at them at your leisure. They are both hosted
on GITHUB in the [[https://github.com/unixbhaskar/dotfiles][*dotfiles*]] repository.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] That means these tools can be run on other platforms like Windows and Mac machines.

[fn:2] You might read or think of it as automation. A kind of process to make things happen behind
the scenes and present you with the effects or results.
