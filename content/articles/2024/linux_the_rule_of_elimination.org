Alright, living with something I love and care deeply about with all my
shortcomings has enabled me to look inside me and my life.

Embracing Linux way back in the late 90s was one of the bloody good decisions I
have made in life that I am so proud of. Despite all the ill advice and
glittering of shallow shiny stuff‚Äôs popularity never fazed me the slightest
bit. See, my tenacity is reflected in my words and I am not saying it for the
sake of getting traction.

Predominantly, the adoption of a particular technology in that nascent stage of
technological embark mine helps me to fathom the nuance of surviving with
it. And since the lesson learned quite early in the stage of getting along,
seems to have had a profound impact on my life.

Initially, two things matter most of the dive into this:

    - The lack of bend of mind of mine
    - The possibility of doing something useful without being clogged.

And that initiates a lot for me. The route is long and torturous(like everyone
else) but the fruit it bears for me gives me a deep satisfaction of
accomplishing something I always wanted to. Nope, I am not complacent nor I ever
will be, because, the damn thing called life keeps coming at you all the time to
embrace something to go forward.

There were phases, where I was super weighed by ever-so-present people‚Äôs blatant
promotion of something very feeble stuff. Later, I discovered, or came to know,
that it was more of a thing about one of them in the herd thing keep their
sanity and ego intact. Never ever bought that notion or encouraged or
entertained anyone to impose that on me. Do I miss out on that? Probably, but I
just didn‚Äôt give a f‚Ä¶ to ponder.

It took me more time than normal to get over the depicted ‚Äúnorm‚Äù of the
schmuck‚Äôs armory than to find out what actually play well. Again, this kinda
realization leads me to some thoughts:

   - I have nothing to prove to anyone.
   - Nor do most people‚Äôs voices ever matter to life.
   - Pleasing everyone is not possible and you have to take some tough call.

I have been sticking to those thoughts and boy! It has provided me rich benefits
over the decades.

Eliminating stuff and people who I figure are not good enough to be part of my
life is the key and it takes me as always more time to evaluate than
necessary. But, in the end, I believe, I made the right decision which helped me
survive in this harsh world.

Linux/UNIX helped me inject a thought that *minimalism‚Äù is the thing and it
should be nurtured and embraced with vengeance. Whether it is about
software/hardware selection or life in general.

Nope, it is not all hunky-dory. It has an inherent cost of ‚Äúnot being part of‚Äù
something very dominant. But, at least that allows me to have a say in my way,
damnit that is what matters most.

The efficiency got tenfold high when I started to discard things and also people
from my life with conscious understanding. It is all I am measuring my way of
looking at life not by the ‚Äúsaid rule of life‚Äù. Did I falter? Yes I did, that
was too many occasions. I felt miserable then, but like everything else, either
it healed itself or I put a conscious effort to get over it. Because sticking
with that trauma will not help to move forward.

Learning from better people and trying to embrace their stuff in my own way of
adopting gave me the realization that putting in an honest effort has long-term
value. And I have been hooked on it since then.

Also, by being really blunt, when I don‚Äôt like something, generally, I don‚Äôt
hold back but let the offender know about my feelings. It clears things in a
jiffy, either we are getting along or we are not. Nope, I am not living in a
glass house and it proved too costly to live in it. üôÇ

Some technical aspect of elimination helps to do my stuff regarding computing,
to a finite set of things, which importantly, I love to do. I have a specific
set of software that helps me to do the day-to-day life operation with a
computer. Special cases arrive very seldom and I obey the rule of it if I really
need that ploy into my workflow.

Open source software is one of the prime ethos of giving you freedom to live
with. But it comes at a price if you are willing to pay for it. The
do-it-yourself is one of the coherent parts of that freedom. Thankfully, the
lesson learned very early days of adopting it. Figuring out with lots of trial
and error methods and striking off what is not so important is a very
time-consuming process and it took me years of perseverance. Sure, we forward
and the requirement gets uplifted but not so much that you have to bring in what
is all available there. The more you have the more time it consumes to maintain
and manage those.

The famous words Less Is More hold very true especially for me the mentioned
reasons earlier in this article. It might be less compared to a plethora of
other things, but very intense to manage and needs more attention to
details. The overhead gradually goes away after some time when you are settled
with those limited options.

I have been running/using Linux exclusively for over two decades and I am a bit
faintly disappointed with it. Yes, from time to time, especially in the early
days, it quote often brought me to my knees, and days were longing and
withstanding the pain it inflicted upon me. It was mostly because of my lack of
understanding and overboard with things that were not so important. Plus,
learning has its bearing too. A self-taught person needs to be more careful and
spend more time evaluating stuff to embrace. Otherwise, the chances would be
high to get your feet in the trap.

I have been aggressively eliminating stuff from computing requirements and in
life too. The road is not smooth nor ever will be. Getting jolted quite often
does not diminish my inclination to optimize resources for betterment. Somehow,
I just can‚Äôt let it go out of my system.IOW, I have been hooked on it for a long
long time.

Getting involved in Linux Kernel development also taught me about the process‚Äôs
Black & White enigma. Visiting expert‚Äôs work and talking to them taught me to
look for something in work, which I was missing completely. Those little
interactions with them cleared so many clouds in my mind and I can apply the
learned lessons more aptly now. Likewise, as am getting older the stupidity of
mine and the other peoples come to light, and blind faiths(had I have any? If at
all)are going into oblivion.

Not necessarily that I hold things tight all the time. I have been proven wrong
many a time in the past. Should I be emotional about that fact? Rather I
swallowed the bitter pill and learned the lesson to forge ahead. I have to take
a leaf out of better to not engage in a spat for an unjustified reason, whatever
the provocation may allude to it.

Learning anything is/was always a steep curve for me and I mentioned the reasons
above. But that‚Äôs not certainly a point try to make again and again that started
to sound like an excuse to not do the necessary things to improve. I have a
barrier (which is extremely hard way ingrained in me), to consume from whom and
discard from what.

I am putting an effort to survive in this world like everyone else.I am not
apologetic about my follies, without them I wouldn‚Äôt be true to myself or
others.
