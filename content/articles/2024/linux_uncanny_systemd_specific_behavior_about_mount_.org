Alright, I stumbled on it like a n00b, if you please say so. But the damn
thing gave me some headache before I understand why the heck it was happening.

Long story short, specifically /Debian/ and /Arch/ were running *systemd* by default
and showing this to me, *not mounting the specific pattern from fstab*. Although,
it was showing *loaded and running* from the systemctl output.

I was a dead rat and furious. After hovering about it sometimes, then came to know
that I have to add a *systemd specific* ,option to the /fstab/ file to get it
mounted automatically during boot.

Firefox's profile has to be mounted on tmpfs, and it was not happening. What I had
in my fstab file is this :

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 firefox /home/bhaskar/.mozilla/firefox/18q9dvrr.default-release tmpfs      size=2G,user,exec,uid=1000,gid=1000                       0 0
#+END_SRC

.....and once I figure out what is needed to add to that line, after that it
looks like this :

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 firefox /home/bhaskar/.mozilla/firefox/18q9dvrr.default-release tmpfs      x-systemd.automount,size=2G,user,exec,uid=1000,gid=1000                       0 0
#+END_SRC

Did you notice the difference??? Damn, it was *x-systemd.automount* , that option
has to be added,then only it can be booted automatically during boot.


I have tried other methods of mounting but to no avail.It was not enabling the
*aumount.unit* , until the option gets added to the specific line. So, the thing
was not showing when running the standard stock /df/ command. The most confusing part
was that /systemctl/ output was showing it was /loaded and active/ .

When I visited that file was missing in the standard location i.e
*=/usr/lib/systemd/system=*.


Now it is showing like this :

I have a file in my home directory like this :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2024-01-29-104021_1920x302_scrot.png]]

Now it is showing properly with the standard df command :
