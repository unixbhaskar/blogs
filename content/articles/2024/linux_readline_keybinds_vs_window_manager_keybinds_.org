Well, Linux has spoiled people with options.Alas! The choices people are making
is horrendous and oftentimes backfires them.But, why that is happening in the
first place? Looking at the tip of the iceberg and imagining the size and shape
of it is very common blunder,and that happens every walk of life nowadays.

So,as the title suggested working on Linux system entice you to use the
venerable command line sometimes, hopefully sooner in your endeavor.And you will
find enthralling effect of it when a minimal key press can do a ton with massive
impact.

GNU Readline[fn:1] comes bundled with most if not all the Linux system out
there. It is such an important /library/, wait, did I say library? And you read
it right.

Now it is coming with some predefined set of key maps, which could be used in
the shell or in the terminal. By default, it is using Emacs's bindings, although
you could have easily changed that to Vim's if you want to. How cool is that!
Not only that if you are overly curious beyond usability of the key binds it
provides, you can program[fn:2] with it too.

Having several window manager[fn:3] has several key binds, because not everyone
follows the same key presses.And the working internal are quite different from
one another.So, in essence,it will simply overboard you mind with various
different keys for various window manager you might have.Although, it is
certainly not a bad thing to have single window manager across distribution and
having similar key binds. Which is what I am used to and having it as my primary
source of operation.

But, having said that, the readline key maps are window manager agnostic and
work similarly with various window managers without any change.Importantly, they
can coexist.

Okay, the million dollar question is, how the heck I know when to use what? The
answer is not that simple.Sometimes,you have ride on your gut feeling for
specific action to be performed or access specific things,in the most convenient
way possible. And the end user have to put their head to find out what would
work best for them. There is no hard and fast rule defined by anything or
anybody.

* How to see and set the readline command bindings in your system

Do this:

Open a terminal/shell and type at the prompt, this :

/bind -P/ ......that is capital P. And you will see something like this on your
terminal/shell:

You can notice on the output, that do *not start with #* are active readline
keybinds in your system. Here are the options you might need to know, when
using the /bind/ command on the terminal:

Okay, every Linux have a file */etc/inputrc* and the content of the file somewhat
look like this :

If you want to *override* the system inputrc file with your own, you might create
a file under your home directory i.e. *.inputrc* and put your bindings in it, as I
did for a few.

The last word of caution is, please do not overburden your dot inputrc file with loads
of key binds.
