Well, we all use this tool[fn:1] somehow knowingly or unknowingly. Sometimes directly
and other times bind with other tools. But this tool is such a present in out
armory to get thing going with daily basis on some operations, that ignoring the
tool become quite impossible.

In this post, I am gonna discuss and process I follow to fix little glitches it
time to time impose on my by not obeying the work it suppose to do.Here are few
common [[https://wiki.gnupg.org/TroubleShooting][GnuPG Troubleshooting]] page contains some instances.

Now, sometimes, the damn agent will die for no apparent reason and I am force to
bounce it with method.Here is something I have ingrained in my /.bashrc/ , so
every time I open up a terminal and applied the method.

The above enlisting is just a small function which basically kill the existing
*gpg-agent* ..and this below trick..

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bhaskar_09:55:43_Sun Jan 14: :~>grep GPG .bashrc
GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export GPG_TTY
#+END_SRC

..reinitialize the terminal it will run.

Whenever It is not working as expected I just call up that function (yeah...yeah
I know it can be automated, but I didn't opt for it for a reason) and voila!

As you have noticed that I have enabled the /debug/ option and directed the output
to a file.Time to time , I folk into that file to ;find out something might be
messing around or not. This is a recommended step to get along with this tool.

Here is an random screenshots I just took while writing this post for your
visual cue.
