Well, modern day computers come along with a new format, physical and logical,
form called /nvme[fn:1]/ way. It is no longer in spindle disk form. And it is fast
and occupies less space inside the chassis. So, the /tool/ to manage this is device
is quite different than the way people used to handle and manage the disk
previously.

*nvme-cli[fn:2]* is the package that ships with all the Linux distributions and
might come in handy. So,go ahead and install it fast. You should be getting it
from your chosen distribution's main repository.

Now,I am going to show you some of the commands this package provides.Some of
the commands need very careful steps to be performed or not to be use them at
all, if you are not doing the prescribed task.In other words,some of the
commands can be prove fatal to play with, if there is no solid reason to invoke
them.

I have stripped the screenshots for the sake of brevity and left them for the
reader to use  on their terminal to see the full output. Because many of the
sub-commands produce quite large output, it is not wise to show here.


Let me give you the entire list from the actual document, where all the commands
are mentioned:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nvme version	Display the current version
nvme list	Lists all the NVMe SSDs attached: name, serial number, size, LBA format, and serial
nvme id-ctrl	Discover information about NVMe controller and features it supports
nvme id-ns	Discover optimal namespace size, protection information, LBA size
nvme format	Secure erase the data on an SSD, format an LBA size or protection information for end-to-end data protection
nvme sanitize	Securely eliminate all data on device, cannot be stopped. Supports block, crypto, and overwrite
nvme smart-log	Health of the SSD (critical warning info), temperature, endurance, power on hours and error summary
nvme error-log	A log that contains information about errors encountered
nvme reset	Resets the NVMe controller
nvme create-ns	Create a namespace, can be used for overproviosning an SSD
nvme delete-ns	Remove a namespace
nvme device-self-test	Simple test for health of a drive, pass/fail
nvme fw-download, fw-commit	Download firmware to the drive, update the firmware on the drive
nvme help	Lists all the available commands
#+END_SRC

You can /update the firmware/ of the SSD with the help of a subcommand.
