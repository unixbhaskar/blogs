Alright, here we are and I thought it would be good to have a place, where all
the scattered stuff put together for the /real lazy people/ and they might be able
to /copy and paste/ stuff from this place.(Dangerous ploy,please don't).

*HEADS UP!* For heaven's sake and your betterment sake, please spend sometime
to figure it out, two things:

-- Why the heck it is happening?

-- And how the heck it is happening?

See, the difference! And bloody important distinction. Kinda ingrained
requirement to get forward and do something meaningful.Those queries keep you on
your toes and for a good reason. It certainly takes up your time, why miser
about it when the damn thing justifiably demand it? You will soon come to know
why it is important to spend time behind things you want to do some productive
work.

I am going to enlist a few /PDFs & text files/ as a reference to fall back on. In
fact, this is the main motivation to get your attention on them. And practice as
often as you can.

Last, but not the least, you can always query /Duckduckgo/ search engine about the
specific cheat sheet and you get it right on the first search page, like this :

No, I haven't forgotten a massive important tool, and we call it the /Swiss Army
Knife/ of system administration. I shall be writing about it in a couple of
days. It deserves its dedicated post.
