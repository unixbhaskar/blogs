#+title: Bibliography Management In Emacs With BibTeX
#+date: 2023-04-11
#+tags: Technical Emacs BibTeX

Well, on my way to getting better, I have discovered a piece of software in one of
my editors(i.e Emacs) ,and the software is called *BibTeX[fn:1]* . See, there is little
resemblance to the short name with the elaboration of the software it consists
off and uses for primarily. That means, with /bibliography management with tex/, you
can come up with more authentic than mine interpretation.

Anyway, while I was managing my bibliographic and note-taking stuff via emacss's
/org-mode/, that is good enough to the job for me. But, then why the switch?
Because,that same stuff can be managed better way with this software.

I have /*ignored* a/ lot of stuff people write and talk about it. Because, those
requirements are not required by me. So, I tried to focus on /my required thing/
than what others dishes out. Am I missing something by restricting myself to a
certain specific thing? Yes, I do. Not yet come the time when I could have
ponder about the other bells and whistle about this specific software.

So, then am I not dishing out /half-baked/ stuff about it?? No, I am not. It
fulfill /my requirement/ and that is why I am writing this,if somebody wanted to
take a cue out of it.

Lets,start with the present scenario,then we go backward to the beginning. Here
is how it is looks like now :

Okay, a little background,before, I opting for to use this software i.e BibTeX ,I
was happily using another method to keep my books and journals and notes in
separate org files(like everyone else) and pull them up with
/org-capture-template/ entry and key binds to insert related info in the specific
file.

Likewise,here in this interface, what you are seeing in the picture on top is
main BibTeX interfaces. It can be used with two precise interface inside emacs,
those are /ivy-bibtex and helm-bibtex/. I am using /helm-bibtex/ and it is quite
alright to me for my convenience.

I have got three specific files, which are having a specific name to express the
job it is supposed to keep.

*bibliography.bib* ---> is the main bib file where all the BibTeX entries get
inducted.

*notes.bin*  --> is the only note taking file related to the bibliography file.

*books.bib* ---> is for keeping all compiled books entry as /pdf/

Now, you can see BibTeX/ needs a dot bib file which should conforms to the
BibTeX format.

If you scroll down in the main BibTeX interface, you can see those files,

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-04-11-113044_1366x768_scrot.png]]


Alright, various things (i.e articles, journals, online, books) have different
predefined temples come with this software.And the default ones are good enough
to get along initially. But, once you get comfortable with this,(like we do for
every other pieces of software we use) then you can churn out your own sadistic
requirement with specially designed templates or modified the default one.

Now, how the heck actually a /bib file/ look likes? Here is a sample

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-04-11-113554_1366x768_scrot.png]]

Okay,how do we enter information like the above in the bibliographic file? There
is way to this in bibtex and it has simple keybind, once in the
bibliographic.bib is open in a buffer, simply type /C-x C-b/ , this will give you
a chance to complete the required format for that specific temples to choose
from. Let me show you, it is look like once you press the key bind

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-04-11-114303_1366x768_scrot.png]]

Alright, there are more options if you scroll down that highlighted bar in the
minibuffer[fn:2] for specific requirement. All you have to do, select the required
type in that list and press enter to fuse the template in that bibliography.bib
file,simple.

Suppose, in that drop down I have selected book and press enter,the template would
look like this in the bibliography file as bibtex entry :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-04-11-114815_1366x768_scrot.png]]

Now, you can see, the default templates are pretty extensive,you probably not
needed all the field to fill in. The fields starts with /ALT or OPT/ are really
optional, that means you can fill them if you want or have information. But,
what are option without those to words,like the first four options, you are
suppose to fill in, that is mandatory. Once, you are done with the entry, you
are suppose to press /C-c C-c/ to get it formatted for bibtex entry. On they way,
it also allocate key for the specific entry to search that item later.You can
modify that entry while on it or access the default chosen one, because, most of
the time it shows sensible keys to attach with the document.Finally, you need to
save the file wit standard /C-x C-s/ and then look at echo area at the bottom of
them screen and it should show *Done, (re) loading the bibliography*. If the
template is not filled properly, and you try to save the file , then it will
complain about that action.So , you need to correct that information then save
it ,then only the bibliography gets regenerated.

There are currently *87* different commands to manipulate bibtex file and I
encourage you go through them at least once,And most of them have shotcut keys
attached with them. If something from that command list is not having key bins
you can bind it yourself and it is pretty trivial to do so.

Say, you have inducted an entry which suppose to have an pdf attachment,how do
you do that? For that operation, you need place your highlighted cursor on main
bibtex interface entry and press /TAB/ to get the action menu like this :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-04-11-121502_1366x768_scrot.png]]

So, you can from the above screenshot that various options are available to use
for that entry.Choose whatever is required for that entry. If you look closely
in the very first screenshot of this page, specifically on the right side
between the year and type there is icons for pdf attachment and having an note
for that specific entry. This icons can be changed through bibtex variable tweak
from /customized menu/ options. Those are kind of visual indicator.

I can open any entry by highlight it and press enter.If the entry has pdf
attachment , it will go ahead and opens the pdf in system wide pdf viewer, in
my case it is /zathura[fn:3]/ .This is because, most of the time I run emacs in /tty
mode/ that means in terminal session.But if you run emacs(like 90 percent of the
people do) in GUI mode then you must have /pdf=tool/ to open the pdf inside emacs,
which is cool.

For note taking related to specific entry as you saw in action page ,there is an
option to /edit note/ one you select by pressing enter ,your designated note files
gets open and allow you to write the note about that entry . Again the
predefined note header and properties can be modified via little lisp coding or
tweaking the bibtex variables.

let me show you a note taking screen ,the process, if I want to take a note on
specific entry on main bibtex entry,then pressing the TAB while the entry is
highlighted will put you in action page like the last screenshot and you have
select /edit note/ and the corresponding note file will get open :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-04-11-122930_1366x768_scrot.png]]

See, my cursor s sitting right on the author and if we go down little and start
writing about that specific subject.Pretty handy, right? And convenient too.

I use /citar[fn:4]/ to manage cite specific stuff, as I said almost all the actions have
shortcut keys available,if not you can bind one by yourself.I have a key bind to
pen cite with key bind /C-c t o/  and it shows like this in minibuffer:

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-04-11-124334_1366x768_scrot.png]]

Now, if I select any of the entry from the above screenshot minibuffer, it will
simply ask me to create a denote file(which a way to backlink with other notes)
or open the attached url or pdf .See like this :


[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-04-11-124546_1366x768_scrot.png]]

Extremely convenient to work around with reference s and notes. There are way
more options than I needed, but the people who are delve with academic papers
might need all those.All in all, this software is extremely powerful for
resource management.

Also, I sometimes take advantage of /org-bibtex/ which greatly help in citation.

Oh, I have made two videos about the process, you might take peek on those [[https://youtu.be/i2jspE5dcBU][Emacs
