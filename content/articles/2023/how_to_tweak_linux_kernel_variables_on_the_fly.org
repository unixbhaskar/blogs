Alright, in this post, I am going to show you, how easily you can tweak the
/Linux Kernel Variables/ on the fly with ease. The kernel comes with script folder,
and it contains so many of the utilities written by the kernel devs for their
easy usability. In turn, ordinary people like us can take advantage of those.

Especially, you can take advantage of a script called *config* which is located in
the script folder. And can be used to /enable or disable/ any specific kernel
variable while building. I have been using it in my kernel building script for
long.

In fact, I have a alias set to call it up whenever I needed like this :

And it can be used inside the /kernel source tree/. If you simply run the script
without giving any options, it will tell you, what exactly you need to do.

So, you can see, that you don't have to prefix the variable you want to enable
or disable this script As the help section clearly stated that, you can only
name the variable without the prefix of *CONFIG_*.


Now, here is the way I have been using it in my script, as stated above,let me
show the specific line :

Likewise, you can use it to enable any specific variable you want. One level of
convenience.
