#+title: Fix The Damn x264 Encode Decode Problem In OpenSUSE Way!

Alright, on a boring afternoon I have given a shot to one of the popular Linux
distributions, called /OpenSUSE-Tumbleweed/[fn:1] yet again after so many years
used it in the past and abandoned it for some issues, which were bugging me
constantly.

So, why this turn around or lean on it again? Just to check, that the
popularity made it change or remains the same. And to my surprise, at least most
part of it looks familiar than foreign. Good sign! But, soon enough the thing, a
little thing hit the ceiling and I had to take a discourse to resolve that
annoyance with their(SUSE's) *recommended* way of fixing the damn thing.

Beginning, just after the install(freshly one) and no other tweak and tried one
of my program to do the job, which does for other four distributions I use.So,
it complains that the *x264[fn:2] codec is unknown*. Pretty known problem, because, I have
encounter it other distribution and I have written about it probably a year or a
few months back(i.e. on Slakcware-current).

After some hovering in the /SUSE Wiki[fn:3]/, I found the page that clearly
tells exactly what needs to be performed, so I followed and voila!

By default, what is coming in the stock /Main OSS and NON-OSS repo/ for that
program I was trying i.e. *ffmpeg* to run from a script to do a specific work and
the error halted that operation. So, went over few rudimentary steps out of
intuition just to check if I am missing something needed by that piece of
software. In fact, there is an *openh264* repository is installed and activated.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
tp_x250_06:27:56_Sun May 28: :~>zypper lr | grep openh264
7 | repo-openh264                    | Open H.264 Codec (openSUSE Tumbleweed) | Yes     | (r ) Yes  | Yes
#+END_SRC

So,still the things *failing* to get along to the job. As mentioned above,I did
some hovering over the SUSE wiki and found it.(I AM WRITING THIS FOR PEOPLE WHO
LIKE ME LACK PATIENCE ,AND TO GET THINGS FIXED FAST).

I am putting all the steps in a script,so it would be convenient to run /at once/
than to do it step by step.Here is the ordinary script:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo Adding repo....

sudo zypper ar -cfp 90 https://ftp.fau.de/packman/suse/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/ packman

echo Rwefresing the repo ...

zypper refresh

echo Vendor change ....

sudo zypper dist-upgrade --from packman --allow-vendor-change

echo Get the actual packages for missing codes ...
echo

sudo zypper install --from packman ffmpeg gstreamer-plugins-{good,bad,ugly,libav} libavcodec-full
#+END_SRC

Do I have to explain it? I believe, those who decided to run this specific
distribution have fair idea what is going on( I am taking the reader of this
post for granted, not a good thing but a chance).

In essence, it is saying(the script) that change or get the required thing from
different repository than use the stuff that come along by default. This is a
community maintained repository.

After this endeavor, all the problem related to running ffmpeg is become
smooth. You can alternatively seen the stuff you get in by the above script,
like this :

You can safely remove the *ffmpeg-6* stuff and let the other version do the job
for you.

Now, what we got to get it working ....

Important things to get from the installed repository...

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-05-28-070215_765x283_scrot.png]]

As you can clearly see, I got the /binary/ of it and letter the "*i"* beside the
package signify that. I also get these below stuffs, you might not...

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-05-28-070610_1366x393_scrot.png]]

..and please do not worry about the error you are seeing, that is
inconsequential, as the specific package is NOT available there.

Finally, we need to get these packages from *packman repository* ..
