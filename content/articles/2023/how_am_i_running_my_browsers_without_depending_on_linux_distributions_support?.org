#+title: How Am I Running My Browsers Without Depending On Linux Distributions Support?

Alright, the title might evoke some frowning. But, wait,I haven't yet explained
the matter in the title. And you don't expect it to be a /clickbait/ one, too.

So, the truth is, you still have to depend on distributions provided /libraries/
to build the browser.And it is a heavy lifting task.

Now, I have stated in many places that, I do not depend on one particular
browser, but have multiple of them, precisely, three of them. Namely,
Firefox[fn:1] ,Vimb[fn:2] and, Nyxt[fn:3] .

And all of them are /*Compiled from the source*/. Why? The primary reason is, I am
using multiple distributions and have common *home* and *data* partitions. These
sources commonly reside in one of them.And every time I boot up any of my OS, those
partitions get mounted too.Hence, the customized and compiled browsers are
available on all the OSes.

I wanted to have a specific /look and feel/ for my browsers, Because, like most of
you, I do spend a considerable amount of time in the browsers too, so the tool has
to have something of my liking and importantly have some features baked into it.

Nope, I do not have any preferences over others. I have selected these software,
because they are different(although provide the same facility) on UI and
build.They use different languages for build and with different principles behind
to have that kind of stuff.

* Firefox

Firefox is widely known and I have been using it since 2008. I have customized
it as per my liking and added and chopped functionality baked into
it.Sometimes,performance hits bad(certainly not like circa 2010-2016), when they
were horrific and I went on trying to variants of it. Some of them work well,
some didn't.But, finally, I have settled on the actual one and stick with it for
some years now. I have a small script, which fetches the latest version of it and
installs it on the system,if I need to. I have also allowed it to upgrade(you can
do so,they have provided the mechanism for that) automatically behind the
scene.Till now it is behaving as I want it to behave.

Here is the script, which might interest you :

cd firefox

# cp  $HOME/firefox/firefox $HOME/bin/firefox

 printf "${Bright}${Magenta} Kill the existing process.... ${NOCOLOR}...\n\n"

 pkill firefox

 printf "Clearing the startup cache ..wait \n\n"

 find ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox/18q9dvrr.default-release -type d -name startupCache | xargs rm -rf
 printf "\n\n Done \n"

cd ..
rm -f firefox.tar.bz2

#start up

firefox --version

firefox&

exit 0

#+END_SRC

While running, it looks like this :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-05-02-170412_1366x768_scrot.png]]

It has a tight integration with /I3 Window Manager/[fn:4] . You can find the two
important files for this look and feel, those are, *userChrome.css* and
*userContent.css* in [[https://github.com/unixbhaskar/AdminScripts][GitHub AdminScripts]]  repository of mine.

* Vimb

This browser is based on the principle of using /Vim/ bindings and utility and
importantly behaves like it. Hence, the name /Vimb/ . My config file related to it
is uploaded in [[https://github.com/unixbhaskar/dotfiles][GitHub Dotfiles]] repository. It has two files, namely, /vimb_config/
and /vimb_style_config/ . While running this browser, it is looking like this :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-05-02-171759_1366x768_scrot.png]]

Again, it has a close association with the /i3 Window Manager/ and it serves me
well. I have heavily tweaked it as per my need, if you glean the above-
mentioned configuration file you could see the effect.

* Nyxt

The last one is called Nyxt. This is an adaptation of a similar time when I get
the above browser. This browser is written in /lisp/ language and pact with
functionality.Distinctively, it has three modes,namely, /Emacs,Vim and CUA/ . I,
personally use this browser with full /emacs/ mode enabled.It is still being
developed. I have customized it too,as per my liking and use. You can find the
configuration file and style file in the *GitHub Dotfiles* Repository. While
running this browser, it looks like this :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-05-02-173225_1366x768_scrot.png]]

No brainier, it too has tight integration with /I3 Window Manager/.

The good thing about running all of these from source is that I can change and chop
as per my need and requirements and, importantly, whenever I want.
