Demystifying the intricacies of some arcane stuff is the forte of goodwill. In
this post, I will let you know/show what the common flags used to make
manipulation to /Apache Web Server/ with *mod-rewrite[fn:1]* module built with it. It is
extremely powerful to maneuver and get precisely the desired result. This
will help people delve into web server management with various domains.

So, here are they,read them for your own sake ..

*[R]	 Redirect you can add an =301 or =302 to change the type.*

*[F]	 Forces the url to be forbidden. 403 header*

*[G]	 Forces the url to be gone 401 header*

*[L]	 Last rule. (You should use this on all your rules that don't link together)*

*[N]	 Next round. Rerun the rules again from the start*

*[C]	 Chains a rewrite rule together with the next rule.*

*[T]	 use T=MIME-type to force the file to be a mime type*

*[NS]	 Use if no sub request is requested*

*[NC]	 Makes the rule case insensitive*

*[QSA]	 Query String Append use to add to an existing query string*

*[NE]	 Turns of normal escapes that are default in the rewrite-rule*

*[PT]	 Pass through to the handler (together with mod alias)*

*[S]	 Skip the next rule S=3 skips the next 3 rules*

*[E]	 E=var sets an environmental variable*


Generally, people write these rules inside the /.htaccess/ file or in the /apache
config file/, whatever way is convenient for you.
