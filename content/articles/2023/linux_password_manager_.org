Well, there are aplenty out there and I had to make a decision many moons ago
and opted for *Password-Store*[fn:1]. And since then I haven't look back or tried
something else, because it fulfills my requirement of storing the various
passwords I have like everyone else. :)

This is essentially a /command line tool combined with GNUPG/ encryption tool to
store the passwords in an encrypted store locally.(This is important to me).

The usability is pretty darn simple and memorable too.You can *insert* and
password to the password store from the command line like this :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-11-27-094811_760x74_scrot.png]]

And it will put you in an editor to enter the details. Once done, you have
to press /CTRL-D/ to quit and save the password.

If your entry needs *multiple* lines of input, then use the *-m* option with the
/pass insert/ command. Something like this :

And the same way you need to save and quit like above. So the uniformity about
using the product is good.

Although I haven't bothered to use these specific options to generate passwords
by this tool,you can avail of this facility by using the *generate* subcommand to
pass binary like this :

It essentially copied the generated password to the clipboard to copy some other
place in the system.

As I have said in the very beginning this tool is taking advantage of /GNUPG/
tool. So, the first thing you should be doing is to use a specific GPG key of
yours to initialize the password store. Like this :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-11-27-100011_535x50_scrot.png]]

It essentially creates a dot directory with the name /.password-store/ and uses
the GPG key you mentioned in the command line to create the password store.

That means you have to have a GPG key of your own to use it with this tool. If
you haven't had one yet, then create it [[https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gpgme/Generating-Keys.html][GPG Key generate.]]

Importantly, on the main website of this tool, you can see the *Migration* section
, where it is described,and how to port it from other password managers to this.

I personally like the lightweight and command line nature of this tool to fit my
workflow and that is why I have been sticking with it for a long time.

If you ever wanted to have a look at the enlisting, just use the *pass* binary at
the command line alone and it will show the content like this :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-11-27-103309_153x98_scrot.png]]

But if you want to see the password of the specific account, then you have to
use the command like below and it will prompt you for the GPG passphrase to
unlock the store to show you the content.

You can *Edit* the existing password entry by using this below command line form :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-11-27-104429_531x48_scrot.png]]

Also, you can *remove* any pass word entry with the help of below command :

[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/2023-11-27-104549_506x46_scrot.png]]

Finally, you can always check the *help* of this tool :

Extremely simple to use but have good enough protection too.
