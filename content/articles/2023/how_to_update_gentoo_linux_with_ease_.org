Alright, what's the fuss all about it?? I have been seeing crackpots shedding
and muddling with complex ideas to make it a thing to worry about. I am sure,
most of them are not even on par with it. And certainly I don't know what they are
up to with that kind of humdrum.

Here in this post, I shall be able to show you how I personally update my long
standing Gentoo Linux system with ease with very minimal fuss.

Basically, I wrote a few lines absolutely ordinary shell script to perform the
job for me. And it's been quite some years now that is doing what exactly I
wanted it to be done.

Here is the script for your perusal :

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

#Syncing with remote repo
eix-sync

#Update the local repo
eix-update

#Actually update the system with fetched in packges
emerge  --verbose --update --deep --newuse --with-bdeps=y  --exclude dev-python/docutils --keep-going @world

if [[ $? -eq 0 ]];then
	notify-send "System has Updated successfully!"
else
	notify-send "Nope, Update is having trouble, please fix"
	exit 1
fi
#Showing what are the packages merge in local system today
genlop --list --date today

#Clean the stale log of previous merge
find /var/log/portage -maxdepth 1 -type f -ls -delete

#Clean the distribution directory to gain disk space
eclean-dist --deep

# It is a custom to rip away the stale stuff from the system after world merge.
emerge --ask --depclean

#Check for security vulnerability by scanning local installed packages.
glsa-check -f --verbose all  && glsa-check -l --verbose all

#+END_SRC

You see! Nothing overly complex to describe to the people. And, while running it
on a dedicated workspace,I do spawn up another terminal where I look at the
package merging time real time. And the script I use , is this :

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

while true;do sudo genlop -c ;sleep 30 ;done

#+END_SRC

it runs in loops to keep going with the merging happening in the other
window. Let me pull up an old screenshot of that activity, so you can visualize
what is going on:

Because, the entire thing is placed on a dedicated workspace(I use I3 Window
Manager[fn:1]),so, it didn't interface with other stuff I might be doing on other
workspace.
