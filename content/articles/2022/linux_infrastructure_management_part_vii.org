* *Backup and Retrieval*

It would be of utmost importance to understand the impact of this activity
i.e. backup. We used to have specific software related to that (good old days!),
which will run at a specific time (generally midnight) to get the backup of a
specified activity. Say, we want to take a backup of some application running on
the specific box or we want to a snapshot of a specific image of the specific
box. Nowadays, it is become even easier, with respect to cloud computing space
it is just a matter of a click!

In case ,if you have missed those previous parts , here they are :

Likewise, we will get it back i.e. retrieval, when things go wrong or people
dependent on specific things get back to the old form.

On the GNU/Linux system plethora of backup and retrieval systems are
available. Not only that even the service or application-specific backup can be
done and retrieved with the tools that come along built into the software. For
instance, what is the most common way to take MySQL(MariaDB) dump by simply
running mysqldump on a specific database, you wish to take a dump. Likewise, if
you are interested to take a backup of any specific LVM thing, then you might
consider looking into the LVM snapshot feature. If you are exposed to AWS then
those features are just a matter of clicks.

I have seen those big silos box in one of the famous IT organization's DC,
probably in older days, other companies had too. Where all the tapes reside and
at the end of the day all the tapes have to be moved to off-site, which means a
safe place as per the policy. Not only that, but I have also had the experience
to see that daily backup in cdrom and put into safe in some off-site (tiny
organization). The bigger the infrastructure the bigger plan has to be rolled
out for this kind of activity and the window should be large enough.

It's not just about taking backups, it is also essential to validate them before
putting them into a safe place or off-site. By not doing that, I have had come
across a situation where backups had been taken but not verified, and when the
bell rings, we found out that those backups got corrupted and we have nowhere to
go..o heck. Nowadays I believe all the software responsible to do involved in
that kind of job, will build into that feature in it. So, we can breathe easily
while retrieving the backup in an emergency.

Okay, as I had worked with a really tiny organization where some costly or
proprietary backup tool was a real luxury to have. They did use the built-in a
tool that comes along with a specific flavor of Linux they were using or get
something that is free. Yep, a lot of smart people are there is an open-source
world who writes and even smarter ones who build and deploy those.

Different industries work in different ways. I mean they deploy a workaround
strategy to deal with it. I have been to different industries and I have seen
quite a few, none match with others, but they all do the same work with
different tools. Even the rsync ran overnight to get the content from one server
to another!!

In the next article, I will discuss the importance of monitoring the infrastructure.
