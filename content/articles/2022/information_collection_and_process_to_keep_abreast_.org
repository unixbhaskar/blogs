Well, it is important to have the relevant information at your disposal in
timely manner and get the essence out of it to utilize in best possible way to
enhance the own knowledge and disseminate the correct one to others. While doing
so,people generally sometimes missed the important stuff from those consumed
content and, in essence, missed the purpose of it. I have been doing/trying to
disseminate the information correct way for a long long time , while doing that ,I
throw away lots of /noisy/ stuff from the information pool I look at for the
information.

Now,the proliferation of the internet allows people to get or look in the nook and
corner ,which were difficult to reach or probably restricted to reach to some
extent ,now can be reached so very easily. But ....but be aware that there is
always */noise to signal/* ratio is pretty high,so you have to be judicious enough
to embrace what is needed and discard what is irrelevant. Having said all this, it is
not so /easy/ thing to do without the help of some sort of tools(read as software) to
achieve or narrowed down the stuff you are interested in or love to process to
gain more knowledge.

*RSS feeds* is a one damn good mechanism to get the interesting stuff at your
disposal with minimal fuss. *Mailing list* for some projects ,especially
technically inclined one. But, there are other ways to get information
delivered to you, and that can be /en masse/ . So, filtering out
the required information needs some careful observation to deduce what to look
for and what not to look out.

And these mechanisms are available for some +years+ decades now. So, having
something at your disposal can be very beneficial,provided you know how to use
those tools properly. Plus, it is a kind of training to the mind, to get the pattern
it is providing or operating on.The sooner you capture the theme, the better it
will be. Plus looking at the sources (yes, you can find out that pretty easily these
days) also determined whether you want to get the information from the source or
not.It is not about rudeness but about the limited capacity you have between the
ears to hold on to information and process. So, to restrict to some sort of periphery
to not get swayed by /unneeded/ stuff.

I do use [[https://newsboat.org/][Newsboat RSS Feeder]]  and [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]] as my prime news feeder. The news items
are delivered in mostly /text/ form . But, it might contain /link/ to other
resources to consume. And for the /technical/ stuff there are /mailing list/ to aid the
information.*Email* is one of the oldest form of information exchange mechanism
and I still do bend on it,most of the time. :)

Here is how those specific tools with information flow look like :

These are not /fancy/ tool which produce eye candy stuff, but are well decorated
pieces of software which deliver what it supposed to build for. Mostly text, but
can be configured to show fancy graphical thing. Tools are important and it is
ever more important to know about the tool ,which you are supposed to use for
long term and daily basis. The more you know about the tool , which you are
using day to day to get your information , the better you can manipulate them to
filter it tight to get only the /absolute required/ stuff. Hence , mitigate the
distraction .

Sometimes,flurry of information stream might boggle you and might be fall for
some */click-bait/* stuff which leads you to consume /red herring/
information. While on the internet , one has to be extremely cautious about what
to consume and, importantly from where. This /decisiveness/ of having stuff /only
from these places/ comes from by being judicious.

It is extremely important to get connected with people who can only feed you with
*/Black and White/* stuff ,in other words ,the truth without much fuss It
saves time for both the parties. Stories don't get well with my system nor I
can stand babbling too much. My eardrums get shut when I sense, if fact I might
present right in front of the babbler. Sounds rude?? Can't help much regarding
that , who the f*** want to hear that?? The habit of listening is considered
invaluable, but you need to make sure , what you listen and whom do you listen and
how much you listen, those parameters decide when my eardrum gets shut.


Awareness is something ,which could be developed over the years of a person's
lifetime and is applicable to every damn human being out there. I don't believe
nor I want to convince myself that someone out there developed it to the
end,YMMV.


Reading can greatly benefit one ,provided they know what needs to be
read. Reading for the sake of reading doesn't make much of a sense ,moreover it
crowded your mind with information which might be completely useless for your
understanding or use case in life. We all have limited time on this earth , why
bother investing in something which only /fill in garbage/ . Plus ,it will consume
your invaluable time of life to whatever you are reading . Because, if you are
not able to practice,whatever you have read/reading or get a chance to do
so,then it might become a burden to carry that essence with you. I am not
rooting for getting /immediate benefit/ but the essence should or must enhance the
experience of life being lived properly by doing something meaningful.

Alright,I have had inculcate a habit of reading and hence writing for the sake
of my enhancement. It is a conscious effort to get better and help others to get
better at it by NOT annoying or poking.(I have seen people , who are extremely
inclined to bestow their understanding on others by some frivolous act) ...not
good though.Stirring the interest on other,regarding anything needs lots of
background check and understanding of the targeted person's inclination. And it
is certainly not a trivial act.

But in today's /pseudo busy/ world ,where people are having an unprecedented
inclination towards getting or achieving everything in very short or less
required time force people to do so many stuff,which they are not suppose do in first
place. Anyway, to make sure you are not fall in trap by looking at /glitz/ of some
furious act or words ,cautious and mindful approach can help. Again , it
developed by when people watch/practice/act/think in the similar manner. That
essentially means, the thought process should synchronize with the act in
mind.

Modern world is flooded with /orators/ . Alas! there is and was always a gulf
between the /effective communicator/ with the previous. If a person not able to
communicate */effective/* way for long, then the chances are pretty bleak to go
forward in any matter. It is a consistent act of doing something very basic, but
very important. On the other hand,/orators/ are full of babbling( I am not
denying that they get a chunk of their share and sometimes the meat of it these
days),but those are not so lasting stuff. It will wipe out quicker than might
have thought.I can sense that form,probably listing to garbage over again and
again make my system to recognize that kind of thing almost /instantly/. And it
probably the case with other people, too.

Information processing is as important as consuming it . Until you process the
consumed information in correct way ,you are not in a position to deal with it
or share in a meaningful way. So, people do not do it right all the time , I
certainly not do it all the time, but I am in quest for improving upon it. In
other words, /the quest is on/  :) Learning from sources you trust and rely can
give you some sort of assurance,as it did to me. I am and was very very
selective about something matters, as I mentioned it early ,some people tag it
as */inhibition/* ,how poor that can be? Extremely poor. As a human being , we
have the right to select what we want and importantly, how we want. Period. But ,
when that conflict with others /preconceived dogma/ then people /judge/ than
evaluate. Again, not good enough.

To reinstate your understanding(or what I do) , I do make sure that I should not
deviate from the topic of thing which I am trying to convey or share with
others.While you are at it,sharing something on that should be considered good
if you add something more meaningful to the already existed context without
reiterating the matter in some /tongue twisted/ wards. That will certainly not
appreciated by the sensible people.

Why bother with the proper information exchange? Because , it is a vicious loop
and if you haven't done it so , it might come back and bite on your arse
someday. It is some sort of /untold/ responsibility to take the ownership of doing
right for the sake of doing it good for yourself.

Flame me with your thought.
